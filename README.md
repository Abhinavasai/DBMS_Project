                           and stock.Object(Item) instantiation is done in this file.
  

2) LoginFrame.java :-      Contains code for Login Frame, checks whether the username and password match in the database from
                           login table and if password match it will enter into MainFrame and if there is a new user the to 
                           Registration Frame.

                           phone number is a 10-digit number and does to confirm password entry match, etc and adds the user to 
                           customer table.

                           in the store and cutomer can add different categories into cart and each category will diplay their
                           products and finally customer can checkout to cart and it will call the CartFrame, also we have a button to

                           of order placed along with user info in the transaction table and once clicked on checkout will lead 
                           customer to Thankyou page(LastFrame).
